Riyadh Guide


Introduction
Vision 2030 aims to make the Saudi capital, Riyadh, a unique and attractive tourist
destination, offering a rich array of cultural heritage, historical sites, natural wonders,
and modern landmarks. “We also aim to have Riyadh become among the world’s most
prominent cities in terms of quality of life, tourism, and services in one way or another,
“the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said This plan recognizes the great potential
to attract international visitors and reflects its commitment to creating an enabling
environment for the development of tourism”[1], We notice the effort exerted by the
General Entertainment Authority in attracting tourists and citizens by holding
entertainment seasons, and establishing places and international restaurants and coffee
shops, With this development and a large number of places and tourist attractions, we
notice that people suffer during the process of searching for an interesting place to spend
time whether on social media or Google map and getting all the information about the
place, also to avoid wasting time while seeking reviews about the place and obtaining an
honest opinion. The technological solution helps save time and effort while searching for
places in an efficient way, moreover, obtaining all the information without contacting the
authorities or  going to them. This document will provide an overview of the problem, the
proposed solution, the product vision, the product roadmap, the objectives of the project,
the scope, hardware/software tools, and the cost of the application development, scrum
team, and at the end the references.
